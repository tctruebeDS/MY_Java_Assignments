    // It would return 150 and then on the next line 150
    // It would do this because there is no tax due to the defauld area code being 1, or New Hampshire as there is no area code provided
    // It would be 150 twice becasue c2 is being set to c1 but there is no new customer being created so the 50 is added to both (I think, I had to run it to find this out)
